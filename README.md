The github page contains results and all plots and scripts necessary to perform regression and plot graphs as they were done in the `Tweaking The Transistor` research paper. Feel free to use this in your transistor research!

### Code Prerequisites
Make sure you install [Python](https://www.python.org/) & [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/). 
You can perform the regression by changing the regression.py script and running it.  
Open the sheet `Fdata.xlsx`, all options should be self-explanetory.  
You can plot by running the command `plotF` in the Octave CLI.
